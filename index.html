    How to Play:<br>
    <br>
    Your Player will be set to Ken. Unlike your conventional arcade fighting game, both    players will start off with a health value of 200.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Both player and computer will start off with 200 Health</li>
      <li>Player and computer have a option to heal or attack. Health is permitted to surpass the starting health so plan strategically</li>
      <li>There is a chance to miss and deal "0" damage</li>
      <li>A round is won when the opponents health reaches 0 or below</li>
      <li>The game is like survival mode. Die once and the game is over</li>
      <li>Each "new-game" the player will get to act first</li>
      <li>On the other hand if you knock out the opponent, the next challenger gets to attack you first so be mindful of your health</li>
      <li>For fun you can click on ken to unleash the well reknowned "Hadouken"</li>
  </ul>
